1. Vowel Sounds
Short Vowels: These are typically found in shorter words. For example, the “a” in “cat,” the “e” in “bed,” the “i” in “sit,” the “o” in “hot,” and the “u” in “cup.”
Long Vowels: These often occur in longer words or when a vowel is followed by a silent “e.” For example, the “a” in “cake,” the “e” in “see,” the “i” in “kite,” the “o” in “home,” and the “u” in “cute.”
2. Consonant Sounds
Voiced vs. Voiceless: Some consonants are voiced (vocal cords vibrate) like “b,” “d,” “g,” “v,” “z,” and “j.” Others are voiceless (no vocal cord vibration) like “p,” “t,” “k,” “f,” “s,” and “ch.”
Th Sounds: There are two “th” sounds in English. The voiced “th” as in “this” and the voiceless “th” as in “think.”
3. Stress and Intonation
Word Stress: In multi-syllable words, one syllable is usually stressed more than the others. For example, in “banana,” the stress is on the second syllable: ba-NA-na.
Sentence Stress: In sentences, important words (usually nouns, main verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) are stressed more than less important words (articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs).
4. Linking Sounds
Consonant to Vowel: When a word ends in a consonant and the next word begins with a vowel, the sounds often link together. For example, “an apple” sounds like “anapple.”
Vowel to Vowel: When two vowel sounds come together, they often blend. For example, “go away” sounds like “goaway.”
5. Common Pronunciation Challenges
Silent Letters: Some letters are not pronounced, like the “k” in “knight” or the “b” in “thumb.”
Homophones: Words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings, like “two,” “to,” and “too.”
6. Practice Tips
Listen and Repeat: Listen to native speakers and repeat what they say. Use resources like YouTube, podcasts, or language learning apps.
Record Yourself: Record your speech and compare it to native speakers. This helps you identify areas for improvement.
Use Phonetic Transcriptions: Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to understand how words are pronounced.
